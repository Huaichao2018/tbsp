# INTRODUCTION 
<div style="text-align: justify"> 
Several recent studies focus on the inference of developmental and response trajectories from single cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-Seq) data. A number of computational methods, 
often referred to as pseudo-time ordering, have been developed for this task. 
Recently, CRISPR has also been used to reconstruct lineage trees by inserting random mutations. 
However, both approaches suffer from drawbacks that limit their use. Here we develop a method to detect significant, cell type specific, 
sequence mutations from scRNA-Seq data. We show that only a few mutations are enough for reconstructing good branching models. 
Integrating these mutations with expression data further improves the accuracy of the reconstructed models.

# PREREQUISITES

* python (python 2 and python 3 are both supported)  
It was installed by default for most Linux distribution and MAC.  
If not, please check [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/) for installation 
instructions. 


* Python packages dependencies:  
-- scikit-learn   
-- scipy  
-- numpy  
-- matplotlib    
-- networkx   
-- pyBigWig  
-- Biopython  
-- decorator
Note that networkx might not work well with some versions of decorator. In that case, consider upgrading or downgrading decorator. For example, "pip install decorator==5.0.7" should solve the problem. 

* other dependencies:   
-- python-dev (python2) or python3-dev (python3)  
It can be installed easily for most linux distributions. For example, debian/ubuntu:
	```
	sudo apt-get install python-dev
	or 
	sudo apt-get install python3-dev
	```
	For Macos, it was installed by default. 
	The python setup.py script (or pip) will try to install these packages automatically.
	However, please install them manually if, by any reason, the automatic 
	installation fails. 

* Platform:  
Macos and Linux verified. For windows, the dependent pyBigWig package is not available.   
However, the Docker version of TBSP is available for all platforms.  

# INSTALLATION
 
 There are 4 options to install tbsp.  
* __Option 1: setup.py script installation from download directory__   
	cd to the downloaded scdiff package root directory

	```shell
	$cd tbsp
	```
	run python setup to install   

	```shell
	$python setup.py install
	```
		
	MacOS or Linux users might need the sudo/root access to install. 
	Users without the root access can install the package using the pip/easy_install with a --user parameter ([install python libraries without root](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7465445/how-to-install-python-modules-without-root-access))ï¼Ž
	 
	```shell  
	$sudo python setup.py install 
	```
	use python3 instead of python in the above commands to install if using python3. 
	
* __Option 2: pip installation from Github__:    

	python 2:  
	```shell
	$sudo pip install  --trusted-host github.com --upgrade http://github.com/phoenixding/tbsp/zipball/master
	```
	python 3: 
	```shell
	$sudo pip3 install --trusted-host github.com --upgrade http://github.com/phoenixding/tbsp/zipball/master
	```
	
* __Option 3: pip installation from PyPI__:   
	
	python 2:  
	```shell
	$sudo pip install  --trusted-host pypi.org --trusted-host files.pythonhosted.org --upgrade tbsp
	```
	python 3: 
	```shell
	$sudo pip3 install  --trusted-host pypi.org --trusted-host files.pythonhosted.org --upgrade tbsp
	```
	
	The above pip installation options should be working for Linux and MacOS systems.   
	For MacOS users, it's recommended to use python3 installation. The default python2 in MacOS has
	some compatibility issues with a few dependent libraries. The users would have to install their own
	version of python2 (e.g. via [Anocanda](https://anaconda.org/)) if they prefer to use python2 in MacOS.    
	
* __Option 4: Installation as Docker images__ (Most robust way, no dependencies on all platforms)  
	Users would need to install Docker to run the tbsp image. Please refer to [Docker installation page](https://docs.docker.com/install/) for detailed installation instructions. 
	
	To install tbsp image:    
	
	```
	$sudo docker pull johnding1986/tbsp 
	```
	To run tbsp image :
	
	```
	$sudo docker run -v /PATH_TO_FILE_DIRECTORY:/tbsp  johnding1986/tbsp 
	```
	Users would need to use the -v command to mount local directories.

# INPUTS AND PRE-PROCESSINGS


* __-i__:    
Required input, this specifies the directory of all SNP(.vcf) files. We recommend using [GATK RNA-seq variant calling pipeline](https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk/documentation/article.php?id=3891) to call the vcfs from .bam (mapped reads) files. 
Users are also allowed to use the SNPs (.vcfs) identified by programs of their preferences (e.g. freebayes).  
We also provied a GATK based SNP calling script (bam2vcf.py) at [bam2vcf](https://my.pcloud.com/publink/show?code=XZH5iFkZz0uXbbvQ8AQznXWoRXBOS0VJUtuV), which automates the SNP calling procedure from .bam files to .vcf files. 
Please use "python bam2vcf.py --help" to see the script usage. 



* __-b__:  
Optional input, this specifies the directory of all bigwig (.bw) files. We provided the script [bam2bw.py](./bam2bw/bam2bw.py) under [bam2bw](./bam2bw) directory to convert the bam files to bigwig files. This files are
used to filter SNPs, potentially redundant to expression. 

* __-l__:  
Optional input, this specifies the labels for the cells. 
File format (tab-delimited):  
```
cell1	label1
cell2	label2
```
These cell labels are only used to annotate the cells in the trajectory.
The other optional parameters are specified above.

# INTEGRATION WITH EXISTING METHODS  
TBSP model provides a SNP MATRIX, which presents the SNP signature vector for each of the cells in the dataset.
As we show in the paper, such SNP MATRIX is very informative for trajectory inference.
The cell trajectories can be improved by integrating SNP matrix with expression data. 

There are many ways to utilize the SNP matrix information, here we used a simple example to demonstrate the integration.  

MONOCLE 2 is used widely for trajectory inference and has very good performance.  However, it's based on only single-cell expression 
data and thus may be limited in many scenarios.  

For example, the following is the Monocle 2 results on a 2016 neuron reprogramming single-cell dataset (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27281220)
![images/monocle_neuron.jpg](images/monocle_neuron.jpg). The processed expression data can be found in the [integration_example](integration_example/neuron_original.tsv) directory. 

(1) In the above results, we observe that d2_induced cells are in a separate branch in the bottom right while the neuron cells are on the branch at top right,
which contradicts the findings in the original study (Trajectory: MEF->d2_intermediate-> d2_induced-> d5_intermeidate-> d5_earlyiN->Neuron), in which the d2_induced cells are serving as the progenitors to the neuron cells.  
(2) Running TBSP on the same dataset, we have obtained 36 SNPs as shown in [integration_example/SNP_matrix.tsv](integration_example/SNP_matrix.tsv).  
(3) Combine the expression features and SNP features.  There are multiple ways to combine these two types of information. 
In the paper, we have discussed the strategy of refining the cell assignment in the expression-based trajectories using SNP information. 
To be more specific, we integrate the SNP information to re-calculate the likelihood when re-assigning the cells to the trajectories. 
Here, we discuss the most naive way to integrate SNP features with expression features: Merge the  features directly. 
For each cell, we put together the expression features (gene expression levels associated with cell) and SNP features (Binary SNP features 0/1 associated with the cell). 

```
expression:
cell	gene1	gene2	gene3 ...
c1	1.6	2.4	3.8 ...
c2	2.8	4.8	6.4	...

+snp:
cell snp1	snp2	snp3
c1	1	0	1	...
c2	0	1	0	...

=>combined:
combined_info	gene1	gene2	gene3	snp1	snp2	snp3	...
c1	1.6	2.4	3.8	1	0	1	...
c2	2.8	4.8	6.5	0	1	0	...

```

Please note that number of the SNP features (usually in the range of 30-100) is much smaller than the number of genes (expression features).
Therefore, to put more weights on the SNP features, we need to over-sample the SNP features.  In the above example, we oversampled the SNPs for 100 times (=> 3600 SNP features). 
The combined dataset for the above example can be found in the [integration_example](integration_example/neuron_combined.tsv) directory. 
 

(4) Run Monocle on the SNP-integrated dataset. 
![images/monocle_snp.jpg](images/monocle_snp.jpg)

The above SNP-integrated Monocle results on the neuron reprogramming dataset perfectly matches the findings in the original study (MEF->d2_intermediate-> d2_induced-> d5_intermeidate-> d5_earlyiN->Neuron).
d2_induced cells nows are the progenitors of the neuron cells. Also, d5 cells are coming later than d2 cells. 
Even using very simple integration strategy as shown above, the cell trajectories can be significantly improved. 

# EXAMPLES
* __Direct Run__:  
	* __Example inputs__:  
	We provided example vcf files under [examples](./examples/vcf_example) folder. 
	To run tbsp on the example data:
	```
	$tbsp -i examples/vcf_example -o example_out
	```

	* __Example outputs__:  
	Example output files can be found under [examples](./examples/output_example) folder.

* __Docker Run__:  
	We provided example vcf files under [examples](./examples/vcf_example) folder. 
	To run docker tbsp on the example data:
	
	```
	$sudo docker run -v ~/Download/examples:/tbsp  johnding1986/tbsp -i /tbsp/vcf_example -o /tbsp/example_out 
	```
	where ~/Download/examples  should be replaced by the parent directory of the folder of vcf files.  The result files 
	are the same as described above.
